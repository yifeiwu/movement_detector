## Mouse Movement detector for HealthHack Melbourne 2016
## Project Description

For this project, we were supplied some videos that show a mouse in a cage. Most of the video consists of uninteresting periods where the mouse is resting. The goal is to detect the interesting periods where the mouse is moving. This python script is designed to detect movement within a video using optical flow analysis from OpenCV.

## Usage

1. Install opencv
2. Configure the import line to where you built the opencv binaries. 
3. Run via `python opt_flow2.py video.mp4`
