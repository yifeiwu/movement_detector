## Mouse Movement detector for HealthHack Melbourne 2016
## Project Description

For this project, we were supplied some videos that show a mouse in a cage. Most of the video consists of uninteresting periods where the mouse is resting. The goal is to detect the interesting periods where the mouse is moving. This python script is designed to detect movement within a video using optical flow analysis from OpenCV. Code can be used to detect general movement for other applications as well. 

## Usage

1. Install pythonopencv
2. Run via `python opt_flow2.py video.mp4`

This produces a csv file with the calculated movement metric for each frame.
